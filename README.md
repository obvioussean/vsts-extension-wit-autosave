# vsts-extension-wit-autosave
Autosave for the Work Item Form automatically saves the work item two seconds after the last user input.

TODO:
* Configure fields to exclude from autosave
* Enable/disable autosave per work item type
* Configurable delay before autosave

Known Issues:
* Assigned to autosave is too eager
* HTML fields move cursor to beginning after autosave
